# BasicLinuxScripts

This repository contains Basic linux bash script.
In this readme , I'll document each function written in each file in the repository.

### Echo
In computing, echo is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments. 
It is a command available in various operating system shells 
and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.

* Example :
echo "Hello world"

## Adding different commands 

You can use predefined commands in your os . 

**For example :**
In dscpeg.sh , I'm using [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) commands to :

 - Blur an image.
 - Resize a second image.
 - Overlay the second image on the first image.
