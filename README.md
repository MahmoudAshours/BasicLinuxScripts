### Echo
In computing, echo is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments. 
It is a command available in various operating system shells 
and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.

* Example :
echo "Hello world"
